# Frontend Application Project

As part of our application process, weâ€™d like to see what you can create given a small assignment. It should take no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

## The assignment

We would like you to create an invoicing app. It should include the following features:

 - Create a new invoice
 - Add line items to the invoice. Line items may include hours of work at a specific rate, work-related expenses, materials, labor, etc.
 - Add notes to the invoice, including an option on how to pay it, where to send checks, etc.
 - An option to send the invoice via email (does not have to actually send emails)
 - View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)

Your backend can be anything, and does not have to work. If you would like to use a mocked-out interface, that is fine (even static data in code is ok).

## Requirements

You should use the following tools to accomplish this task:

 - Javascript/HTML
 - Any frontend framework or no framework.

If you have any questions, please ask!

To complete this projecet, please fork this repo and commit your work to your fork. When you are ready for us to look at it, give us access to your fork so we can review and run it.


Solution:

I have implemented an application using React.js. This is my first attempt working with React.js. I referred to 
mutiple Youtube videos and some tutorials to get basic knowledge and come up with this. One of them in particular very much resembled to the requirements. I followed and incorporated custom changes to it.

- Create a new invoice
   The application can generate an invoice

 - Add line items to the invoice. Line items may include hours of work at a specific rate, work-related expenses, materials, labor, etc.
   There is option for items/ jobs.

 - Add notes to the invoice, including an option on how to pay it, where to send checks, etc.
   Notes can be added.

 - An option to send the invoice via email (does not have to actually send emails)
   There is option for printing the invoice and just a button to show sending emails can be incorporated
   
 - View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)
   There is a field called Payment Status which can be edited to show the status.
